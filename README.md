# Todo App

This is a simple Todo app built with Vue 3.  
I created it to practice my Vue 3 skills and experiment with modern frontend tools.

## Features

- Mark todos as completed
- Todos are stored in your browser's local storage
- Responsive and modern UI using Tailwind CSS
- Uses [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) for helpful Vue composables
- Modal dialogs powered by [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/vue)
